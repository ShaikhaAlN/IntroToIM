## exercise one
- we found a way to use the light sensor and petometer to control the x position and y position of the circle and it was fun to play around with the controls for a while.
## exercise two
- using a simple circuit, i used the buttons 1 and 0 to determine the brightness of a led, however, this communication wouldnt go through between my computer and my arduino. ive placed the code in a seperate file.
