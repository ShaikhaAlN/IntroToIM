## initial ideas
- While completing this weeks homework, i found the first exercise really fun and interesting since i managed to use two sensors to control the position of the circle.
- one final project idea would be to use the grid feature in p5.js to create a sensitive maze where if you touch the walls of the grid you lose or a buzzer sound plays and you lose a 'life'.

- another idea would be a picture of a lighthouse with a light that blinks in morse code depending on the letters that the user puts in with their keyboard

- another idea built on a homework that ive done where i used two led lights in a creative way, using a light sensor/potentiometer/button to 'break into' a vault that rotates and clicks at different points on the screen.

- another idea i had would be to use three buttons to control a music beat game where different colors pop up
