## initial plan
- at first, i knew i had two ideas in mind that i wanted to try out and experiment with, one being using a spray bottle, and the other being a plant and vase. 
- i knew that the spray bottle would take less time so i used this to pracrtice and familiarise myself with using aluminium foil.
- i started by creating a simple circuit on the bread board of a led with a 330 resistor and connecting it to 5V and the GND on the arduino board.
- i then used two wires instead of one to connect the resistor to the positive end of the led so that i could construct a switch that would turn the led on when these two wires connected in some way

## Spray bottle
- for this 'switch', i wanted it to activate once the spray bottle trigger was squeezed. 
- so i attached the first wire on the trigger by wrapping it around aluminium foil, and did the same to the second wire, wrapping it around the neck cap.

- i used tape to secure the aluminium and made it thick around the neck cap so that the trigger wouldnt have to be squeezed fully to activate the switch.
-  this way, the led would briefly turn on everytime the spray bottle was used.

## Plant and vase
- for this 'switch', i wanted it to activate once the plant was placed inside the vase.
- this item was a bit more difficult as i didnt know how much aluminium i needed to use both around the plant and inside the vase. 
- i started by created a spiral-like shape using the aliminium and inserting it into the vase along with the first wire, and partially wrapping the end of the plant in aluminium and the second wire.
- since i couldnt have much control over how the aluminium moved when it was inside the vase i faced some trouble with the led flickering or not turning on at all.



- to solve this, i placed a larger bundle of aluminium into the vase instead of trying to create a stiff shape.



- although this made the led turn on more frequently, it still flickered. so i remedied this by also wrapping the tip of the plant in aluminium to establish a quicker and more consistent connection.
