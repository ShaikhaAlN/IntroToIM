## challenges
- it took me a while to get used to the while and for functions when creating loops of shapes
- I couldnt figure out how to loop the triangle shape so i coded each one in the pattern
- the stars was made of individual lines and it took a while to coordinate each one appropriately
## what i learned
- complicated looking artwork can be made of simple loops
- randomizing the colors each time gives it an entirely new feel and draws attention to different shapes.
