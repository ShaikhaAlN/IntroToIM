- The end result of my game ended up having 8 stages, where the user can interact with ingredients to 'bake' a cake. 
- i really enjoyed the whole process, from making each individual pixel image to programming the buttons. 
- although i would have liked for the game to be faster, i learned a great way to switch between a number of stages without relying on transparency
