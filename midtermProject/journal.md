## Inspiration
- initially, i was heavily inspired by the cooking games i grew up with and loved playing. ive always had such a vivid memory of the different interactions and steps the user would need to take to complete a recipe.
- i was especially fond of the game below because of its attractive pixelated interface and range of possibilities

- So first, i started experimenting with creating pixelated art in order to insert them into the game as images
- i wanted to create a simple game in which the user would combine different ingredients to make a chocolate cake
- i used the procreate app for the images and created a new brush that had a square shape to create the pixelated effect. i started modelling the different aspects such as the avatar, flour, bowl, chocolate, and eggs.
- after downloading them however, since the pixels were so small, the image became blury everytime i tried making it bigger. so i used a [pixel art scaler website](https://yal.cc/r/19/upscale/) to scale the images and make them bigger so that the resolution would be maintained no matter the size of my canvas
- here are some example of the images i created:

- Since in my previous assignment where i created a cereal simulator i used arrays, i dont think i would have much trouble adapting the principle again and improving on it. 
- however, i think the hardest thing i faced in that assignment was trying to figure out how to change a aspect of the program with a mouse click in a way that would last and not disappear momentarily after the mouse is clicked.
- I wanted to create a stage in this game where the user can crack an egg
